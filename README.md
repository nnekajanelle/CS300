# CS300
There were two big projects I had to do for this class that taught me about data structures and methods.  I went through Project One and wrote about how fast and how much memory different data structures use.  I added the code I used in Project Two that sorts and prints out a list of Computer Science classes in ABC order.  All of these projects together show what I've learned about using the right computer tools to get things done, such as vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees.

 I tried to find the best way to store and organize course data in both projects so that it could be quickly sorted, found, and shown.  The program had to do different things, so I had to pick from different data models.  Because of this, binary search trees were great for keeping things in order, and hash tables were great for quickly finding specific data.  Figure out when and why to use each one. This taught me how important data structures are for making good software.

 As I worked on these projects, I ran into some problems.  I had trouble getting the binary search tree to show up right at one point, and I also had trouble adding data from a CSV file.  Print lines helped me figure out what was wrong with my code, and I read examples from class and the book to fix them.  I also found that breaking problems down into smaller steps helped me concentrate and get things done faster.

 The projects I worked on changed the way I think about making programs.  Before, I would start writing code right away. Now, I think about what the program needs and what data format will work best.  I also got better at making code that is clean and simple to understand.  I gave my variables clear names, wrote notes to explain what my code did, and put everything in order to make it easier to read and change later.
